CS 222 Project 1

This is a program to allow a user to input a search key and return a page
from Wikipedia. If a page is retrieved it will show up to 15 users who edited 
the page and their time stamps. It will also show the redirected search key in the
event the full key is not entered. Example: "babbage" redirects to "Charles Babbage"

Usage: Run program from Main.java
